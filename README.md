# House-Prices

## Data: 
Data was obtained from kaggle. There were 1460 samples, containing around 80 features like no. of rooms, house area, garage quality (if present), kitchen quality, electrical connectionsâ€™ quality etc, and the goal was to predict sale price of the house.


## Data exploration and preparation: 
- Imputation
- Dummies from categorical features
- Feature extraction, like age in place of year when built, etc
- Standardization


## Models used:
Tree-models:	
- XGBoost
- GBM
- ExtraTrees
- RandomForest
- AdaBoost
- Bagging

Linear-models:	
- Ridge
- Lasso
- LassoCV
- LassoLars
- ElasticNet
- BayesianRidge
		

## Hyperparameter tuning:
- 10 fold CV + GridSearch;
- 10 fold CV + GridSearch + RandomSearch, always better than GridSearch;
- 10 fold CV + GridSearch + Genetic algorithm:  stuck in local optima, sometimes better than RandomSearch;                       
- 10 fold CV + GridSearch + Bayesian optimisation:  performed the best in most cases.


## Final ensemble:
- Stacking


## Result:
- R2 score on train set: 0.889743
- R2 score on test set: 0.87435
